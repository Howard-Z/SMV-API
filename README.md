/smv/

Things to Consider: the sqlite file is the entire db, should we really be commiting this to gh?

Further Considerations(Matthew): /n
- add "trips" column to differentiate between different tests?
- refresh rates for diff types of data and what should be stored
- add error messages: function error() that display if data goes outside normal bounds
